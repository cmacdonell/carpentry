How to choose between Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry
===========================================================
**(or things I think I think)**

by ***Cam Macdonell*** (@cjmacdonell)

I've been a certified [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org)
(SWC) instructor for about 2 years.  Last week, I had the privilege of teaching
my first [Data Carpentry](http://datacarpentry.org) (DC) workshop last week.

Teaching this bootcamp gave me some insight into the audience of DC.  While one
should be careful of conclusions drawn from a single sample, this audience
was broad - physical scientists, digital humanities researchers and librarians.
Another interesting
aspect was that this bootcamp was held in parallel with a Software Carpentry
bootcamp following the [HASTAC 2015](http://www.hastac2015.org) conference, so
attendees had a choice, so this got me thinking "How do you decide?".  Whether
an individual choosing to attend or an organization deciding which type of workshop
to host.  Perhaps I can help.



What you will get from either bootcamp
--------------------------------------
Before we dive into differences, a brief word on the similarities.  Both SWC
and DC are needed, and either bootcamp will offer important skills that are
beneficial to people with any of the "challenges" mentioned above.  In
particular, I think there are important benefits that
come from the carpentry bootcamps regardless of the particular skills taught.

***An understanding of computation***

Experienced programmers and data scientists understand that any data stored on
computers can be accessed and manipulated with the right tools.  As well, there
is always "more than one way to do it" with
computers.  I believe that bootcamps will always help to de-mystify the kinds of tasks
we all rely on computers for - communicating, calculating and illustrating.
Windows, Mac or Linux; Python or R; there is a common thread running through all of
it.

***Analyzing data***

Both bootcamps are suited to learners who want to analyze data.  Calculating
any mixture of sums, products, means, medians, modes and presenting that data
in text or graphically.  Doing these tasks relies on the tools of the language
(R or Python), but both can do it.  In both bootcamps you'll learn about loading
data into your own program, using variables, calling functions and outputting your
results, simple or complex as they may be.

***Learning the lingo***

It may seem insignifcant, but some workshop attendees I've spoken with are most
grateful just for knowing that after a bootcamp they
will be more confident when talking with other researchers, programmers or
database admins about problems they're having.  They come away with a better
grasp of the terminology and tasks and now
are less concerned about sounding foolish when in discussion with the computer
folk wherever they work.

***Tools***

The majority of tools taught between the two bootcamps are very similar - bash,
SQL and
regular expressions and the CSV data format can be covered well in both.  
A discrepancy comes in the programming language, R vs. Python.  Python is taught
more often in SWC, and R in DC.  However, both types of bootcamps have taught either.
So the difference really comes in what attendees want to be able to do, and this
is where the bootcamps diverge, so let's get on to choosing between them.

Choosing Software Carpentry
---------------------------

***Your experience***

The established audience for Software Carpentry is labratory scientists who find
themselves programming without any training.  They want to learn how to
write better programs.  I would argue the top three lessons of SWC are

* advanced features of Python (functions and data structures)
* version control
* storing data in SQL

The elevator pitch is: 100+ line "scripts" (programs with no functions) are a
bad idea, so SWC teaches functions and data structures.  Also, code that is
used by people but is not version-controlled is also a bad idea, so SWC teaches
emphasizes the need and use of version control.

If you have programmed as part of your job at some point and want to be better
at it, then SWC is for you.

***Your tasks***

Another metric to help you decide the bootcamp is the kind of tasks you or your
audience is interested in.  If those activities require
"General Purpose Programming", then SWC is the right choice.  Why?
Because SWC teaches Python and Python is a general-purpose programing language.
What kind of tasks require general-purpose programming? Here's a brief list that is common
among attendees:

* Pulling data from websites (i.e., Web scraping)
* Sequence analysis
* Interactive Visualization or Modelling
* Simulation
* Building Web applicatons
* Accessing APIs (HathiTrust, Twitter, etc).

If you have to manipulate data in ways other than for statistical analysis, you'll
likely need Python and SWC is the bootcamp that will teach these lessons.

***An Inexperienced Audience***

Earlier I said that SWC was targetted to people who had programmed before.  Ya,
mostly.  But SWC lessons *and instructors* are flexible and can work with
almost any audience, but they need to be told of the audience level.  Bootcamps
can be very successful even if the audience have not programmed before as long
as the instructors know this and can teach Python from the very basics.

Choosing Data Carpentry
-----------------------

So who is Data Carpentry (DC) for?  I would argue that Data Carpentry is targetted
to people who are managing, preserving or analyzing data.  If you want to make
graphs or charts, gather statistics and/or share data within your institution
or across the world, then Data Carpentry is what you want.

I would argue the three top lessons from DC are

*  The importance of clean, accessible data and how to achieve it
*  Managing and processing large quantities of data
*  Analyzing and presenting statistical data using R

The elevator pitch for DC is: You have data spread across Excel, CSVs and other
files and it's hard to analyze, we can help you manage it with basic
shell skills and clean it using OpenRefine.  Or if you want to share data with other
researchers and help them re-run your analysis, we can teach you how to write
basic R programs and how to share them easily.

***Your experience***

Data Carpentry attendees are often those who find themselves swimming in digital data
and figure there must a better ways to manage it.  Excel? CSVs? Online or offline?  What
are these?  You want to understand what the differences between formats and
methods of accessibility.

Another audience would be researchers who collect data, but find returning to
analyze previous data (from themselves or others) is frustrating due to poor or
inconsitent formatting and storage.

***Your tasks***

The tasks a Data Carpentry attendee would hope to learn typically sound something like:

* Statistically analyzing data and producing graphs
* Maintaining and preserving data
* Making data files consistant so they can be easily analyzed
* Storing research data so it can be reused
* Moving non-digital data (print, books or images) to digital formats
* Helping researchers access data

I believe the strength of Data Carpentry is de-mystifying data and teaching
very practical lessons and tools to make working with data easier and more efficient.

Summary
-------

I believe the above is at least a first step to disambiguating Software and
Data Carpentry.  Again, I believe both are useful, necessary and that any attendee
will take something away from either bootcamp.
As I continue to teach both bootcamps, I'm sure I'll gain greater
insight, but I hope the above is useful.

If I can offer one more common trait
of both bootcamps, I would say it is **an appreciation of the "carpenters"**.
Like any work, writing programs and wrangling data is often a frustrating task.
Hardware and software
can be finicky, poorly designed or confusing in operation.  Often a divide can occur
between the "computer people" and the "non-computer people".  I think exposure to
what makes up the day-to-day tools and tasks of those who work with technology at
a significant level can help bridge the divide.
